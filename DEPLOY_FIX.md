# Deploy Health Check Fix

## Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **Go Backend URL**: Updated environment variable for production (`localhost:8081` instead of `go-backend:8081`)
2. ✅ **Supervisord Configuration**: Fixed missing supervisord.conf content that was causing deployment failures
3. ✅ **Cleaned up duplicate Go backend**: Removed `go-backend/` directory, now only using `mainote_server/`
4. ✅ **Updated all build scripts**: All scripts now build and run the correct `mainote-backend` binary

## Quick Deploy
```bash
fly deploy
```

## Verify Fix
After deployment, check the health endpoint:

```bash
# Check overall health
curl https://mainote-bot.fly.dev/health

# Should return status: "healthy" with all 3 services working
```

## Expected Healthy Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T23:30:00Z",
  "services": {
    "python_bot": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "bot_initialized": true,
      "application_initialized": true
    },
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "type": "postgresql",
      "connection": "active"
    },
    "go_backend": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "response_time_ms": 3.4,
      "backend_status": "healthy",
      "backend_version": "1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "summary": {
    "healthy_services": 3,
    "total_services": 3,
    "health_percentage": 100.0
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
If still having issues:

```bash
# Check logs
fly logs

# SSH into container to test internal connectivity
fly ssh console
curl localhost:8081/health
curl localhost:8080/health
```
